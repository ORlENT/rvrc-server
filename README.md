## Points Feature
War Games Leaderboard helps to account for all the points that are transacted for the groups. It has a total of three different sections which are leaderboard, farms and battles. Camp leaders will be using this web application to tabulate scores for their own groups and attack other groups or farms for points. The leaderboard shows the group points sorted in descending order. The farm section shows the different farms that groups can attack to get points. The battle section is the summary of all the transactions of the battles and transactions of points.
